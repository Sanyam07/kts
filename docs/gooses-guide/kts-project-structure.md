# KTS Project Structure

To create a project, just type `$ kts init`. It will create the following structure:

```text
/input           # just for your comfort. put input files here
/notebooks       # you may want to store notebooks in a dedicated dir
/storage         # the only truly needed dir, contains cache
/submissions     # ...
/output          # ...
/kts_config.toml # config
```
